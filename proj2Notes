InitUser
1. Construct userdata object. 
2. Generate DS Keys AND PKE Keys.
3. Store public keys (step2) into keystore.
4. Generate SYMMETRIC encryption key from (secure) password. Convert UD to bytes, encrypt. 
5. Sign encrypted UD with DSSign, and append to end.
6. Store userdata under SYMMETRIC KEY, since this is deterministic

GetUser
1. Re-create Symmetric Encryption Key (and thus Datastore Key) based on username + PW. 
2. Verify Integrity of Userdata object, using verify key from keystore. 
3. Verify password (possibly repetitive) by recreating salted secure pw and checking. 
4. After checks pass, decrypt user data. 
5. Unmarshal user data, return to userdataptr.

StoreFile
1. Create File Metadata object.
2. Encrypt and Sign FILE DATA object, using the designated file symmetric key and MAC key
3. Store filedata under UUID (also part of file metadata).
4. Assign file metadata specific encryption/MAC keys!
5.
